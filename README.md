This is a code I wrote for myself that I'm working on cleaning up and making more usable for others. Basically, it abstracts away the details of a specific cluster or queue system and makes running jobs across many supercomputers and clusters much more straightforward.

This is very much a WIP which is why I don't have any documentation up here yet.
